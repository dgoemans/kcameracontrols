- Keep commit messages short and cover the biggest changes only
- Avoid adding descriptive texts like "for clarity", "for readability"
- Avoid prefixes like fix, feat, chore, etc.
- Describe what the commit does in present tense, eg: "Add event summary query and endpoint", "Refactor getProductInfos query into smaller functions"
- If possible, start the commit message with a verb.
